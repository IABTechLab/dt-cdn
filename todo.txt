x    [user’s browser] Publisher loads DT library on user web request
x    [user’s browser] Partner calls DT method to get the user’s latest digitru.st identity cookie
x    [user’s browser] Partner knows the user (from their own server-side dataset), determines that user should be opted out, but the digitru.st identity cookie is not up to date
    [optional - partner’s server] Partner creates a “message id” (MSG1) on their own server to pass to DT.optOut()
x    [user’s browser] Partner takes “message id” (MSG1) generated on the server and passes it via DT.optOut()
x    [digitru.st iframe] DT receives “optOut()” request, and needs to verify if the sender is a partner
x    [digitru.st iframe] DT responds with public-key encoded MSG1 to create CHAL1. SOL1 (the solution to CHAL1) is saved in digitru.st cookie space - to be verified later.
x    [user’s browser] Partner receives response to DT.optOut() with CHAL1
x    [partner’s server] Partner forwards CHAL1 to own server to decrypt and validate CHAL1 (with private key). Solution is SOL1.
x    [user’s browser] Partner takes SOL1 from own server and passes it to DT.opOut()
x    [digitru.st iframe] DT validates the signal and updates the cookie.
x    [digitru.st iframe] Sends message back to partner confirming opt-out
